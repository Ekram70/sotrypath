# StoryPath

Welcome to the **storypath** repository. **Storypath** is an interactive storytelling platform designed to engage users through dynamic and branching narratives. This platform allows users to both read and create stories with multiple pathways, driven by their choices.

This project is a full-stack web application, consisting of a client-side (front-end) and a server-side (back-end). The project is organized into two main directories: `client` and `server`, each containing their own `package.json` file for managing dependencies.

## Getting Started
